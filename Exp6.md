# Experiment 7: Git Commands to Create a Lightweight Git Tag (v1.0)

## Prerequisites

- A local Git repository must be initialized. If you donâ€™t have one, initialize it with:
  ```bash
  git init
  ```
---

## Steps to Create a Lightweight Tag

### 1. Verify the Repository State
Ensure that you are in a valid Git repository:
```bash
git status
```
This command will show the current state of your repository.

### 2. Identify the Commit to Tag
To create a tag, you need the commit hash of the commit you want to tag. Use the following command to view the commit history:
```bash
git log --oneline
```
This will display the commit history in a concise format. Note down the desired commit hash.

### 3. Create the Lightweight Tag
Use the `git tag` command to create a lightweight tag. Replace `<commit-hash>` with the commit hash you noted earlier:
```bash
git tag v1.0 <commit-hash>
```
If you want to tag the latest commit (HEAD), you can simply run:
```bash
git tag v1.0
```

### 4. Verify the Tag
To confirm that the tag has been created, list all tags in the repository:
```bash
git tag
```
You should see `v1.0` in the list of tags.
