# Experiment 11: Git Revert Command

## Overview

The `git revert` command in Git is used to create a new commit that undoes the changes made by a specific commit. This is useful for reversing changes from a commit without altering the project's history. Unlike `git reset`, which modifies the history, `git revert` is a safe way to undo changes in a collaborative environment, as it does not alter the commit history.

## Usage

```bash
git revert <commit-id>
```
